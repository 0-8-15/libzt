### To build entire distribution package:

Step 1: On a Windows host, run `make dist`. Outputs will be copied to `prebuilt/(debug|release)/(win32/win64)`
Step 2: On a Linux host, run `make dist`. Outputs will be copied to `prebuilt/linux-$ARCH`
Step 3: On a macOS host, run `make dist`. Outputs will be copied to `prebuilt/macos-$ARCH`
Step 4: Perform any necessary modifications to the generated projects (such as Xcode projects)
Step 5: Re-run `make dist`
Step 6: On a Unix-like host, run `make package`. This will zip everything up into a pair of `tar.gz` files in `products`

### Android

This project is not currently generated by CMake, but does utilize the `CMakeLists.txt` and generates a `.aar` Android Archive which can be imported into an Android Studio project as a library. An example of this library's usage can be found in [examples/android](examples/android). Further examples of the libzt JNI API can be seen in [examples/java](examples/java).
